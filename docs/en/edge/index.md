# Edge AI

This section focuses on **Edge AI engineering**, exploring how AI models run efficiently on **mobile devices, embedded systems, and industrial terminals**.

## Topics Covered

- Edge inference optimization (INT8 / FP16 / mixed precision)
- Deployment on Android, Linux, and embedded platforms
- RKNN, NCNN, TensorRT, OpenVINO
- Camera → inference → production pipelines
- Trade-offs between latency, power, and stability

## Who This Is For

- Edge AI engineers
- Mobile and embedded developers
- Engineers focused on real-world deployment

> Edge AI is not a compromise — it is engineering under constraints.
