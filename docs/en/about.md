# About AiPrism

**AiPrism** is a technical knowledge site for engineers, developers, and technology enthusiasts, focusing on **Artificial Intelligence**, **software engineering**, **system architecture**, and **real-world engineering practices**.

We believe that:

> Technology is not isolated knowledge — it reveals its true value when examined through multiple practical perspectives, like a prism.



## What is AiPrism?

**AiPrism = AI × Prism**

- **AI** stands for artificial intelligence, data, models, and automation
- **Prism** represents multi-angle analysis, decomposition, and reusable engineering insight

AiPrism aims to break down complex technologies into **clear, practical, and reproducible engineering knowledge**, helping developers understand not only *how things work*, but *why they work that way*.

## Writing Philosophy

AiPrism follows a few core principles:

- **Engineering-first**: practical, reproducible, and maintainable
- **Long-term thinking**: knowledge accumulation over time
- **Structured content**: less fragmentation, more systematization
- **Bilingual approach**: content in both Chinese and English

This is not a “quick tutorial” site, but a **living technical knowledge base**.



## About This Site

- Built with **VitePress**
- Deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**
- Static site with **bilingual structure (ZH / EN)**
- Focused on long-term technical branding and knowledge sharing

All content is original or derived from hands-on engineering experience.



## About the Author

AiPrism is maintained by a software engineer with long-term experience in:

- AI model training and deployment
- Engineering-oriented AI systems
- Platform and tooling development

Writing is a way to **document real-world experience, reflect on decisions, and clarify thinking**.
